Linux Vs Windows

1. Open Source 

2. Security 
     - CLI (command line interface) , in Linux by default GUI is disabled
     - Softwares Download (user permissions are so strict or limited in linux)

     client OS - WINDOWS (the laptop org provides for emplooyee)
     server OS - LINUX (this is where our applications are hosted)

How to che the linux dirto?
cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Amazon Linux 2"


Basic Commands

ifconfig    - pvt IP
curl ifconfig.me   - public IP
clear - clear the screen
cat - read the file
whoami  - which user we are currently working as
pwd   - present working Dir
ls - list contents of current dir
cd  - change directory
sudo -i - switch to root (sudo su -)


Directory Structure in Linux

/
home    root    etc   dev   boot   bin   sbin   tmp   var   usr  mnt   opt    ..... 
test1   test2
test3   test4


Path Strategy

1. go to test2
   cd /root/test2               ; pwd - /root/test2

2. go to test3
   a. cd /home/test1/test3       ; pwd - /home/test1/test3     (absolute path)

   b. cd ../../home/test1/test3  ; pwd - /home/test1/test3     (relative path)

   c. cd /                       ; pwd - /   
      cd home                    ; pwd - /home
      cd test1                   ; pwd - /home/test1
      cd test3                   ; pwd - /home/test1/test3  

/    - base dir (:C/ Drive in windows)
home - Everyuser has a deafult home dir in "/home" with name same as username (Desktop of user)
root - home dir of root user
etc  - all the system settings and application settings are stored here 
dev  - all the devices connected to my server
boot - kerneel and boot time requirements
bin  - Binaries (programs of the commands)
sbin - system Binaries
tmp  - system purpose (auto-deletion of conents not used for over 30 days)

Creating Files and Directories

Creating Directories

mkdir <dir-name>
rmdir - removes empty dir
rm -rf dir - (r-recursively, f-forcefully)

Creating files

1. touch
2. cat
3. vi editor
   vim
   nano

1. touch file  - create an empty file
2. cat   file  - read the conents
   cat > file  - to write the data, also over-writes the existing data
   cat >> file - to append the data

3. vi editor
   works on three modes
   a. Escape mode  (default mode)          
   b. Insert mode  (editing mode)          ---INSERT--- 
   c. Command mode (save/discard changes)  :

   Insert Mode - i,I,a,A,o,O
   i - start insterting from the current position
   a - start insterting from the one step current position
   I - start insterting from the beginning of the line
   A - start insterting from the ending of the line
   o - Insert a new line below the current line
   O - Insert a new line above the current line  

   Escape Mode - Esc key
   G  - go to last line
   gg - go to first line
   yy - copy the line
   p  - paste the copied line
   dd - delete the current line
   u  - undo the previous action
   ctrl+r - re-do the previous action  

   Command Mode - :
   :wq!   (:-command mode, w-write/save, q-quit/close, !-forcefully)
   :q!
   :wq
   :q
   :set nu (give a temporary numbering to the lines )
   :se nonu

   cp file1 file2 (flie1- path of source file , file2- pathe of dest file )
   mv file1 file2 (same as above , and alos rename the file)

User management

useradd user - create a new user
  - uid
  - username
  - gid
  - groupname
  - home dir

id user      - check whether the user is present
passwd user  - to set the password  for the user
userdel user - remove the user

how to check all the users in the  server ?
cat /etc/passwd

how to check all the group in the  server ?
cat /etc/group

groupadd group - create a new group

how to PasswordAuthentication (Provide login access) to the users ?
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 edit (PasswordAuthentication no to yes)
systemctl restart sshd

how to provide sudo access to the users?
vi /etc/sudoers
 add at EOF (user  ALL=(ALL)   ALL)


Tasks
1. How to provide password less sudo access to a user in linux?
   vi /etc/sudoers
   <user_name> ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD:ALL

   
2. How to provide sudo acces for user in linux to specific commands? (limited sudo access)
   ex: user should be able to add users but not delete or anything else
   execute (sudo useradd user)
   lakshman ALL=(ALL)       /sbin/useradd

To check the logs and audits    
cat /var/spool/mail/root
cat /var/log/audit/audit.log

Managing Applications

Windows - .exe
          .zip 


Linux   - .rpm (redhat package managers)
        - .zip/.jar/.tar
        - binaries
        - yum (yellowdog updater modified) - package manager in Redhat family
          ex:- yum install/remove pkg
 
          apt install/remove pkg (ubuntu, debian)  



wget  - to download content from internet
curl  - check url (to check th communication or availability)
        along with -o option it is also capable of downloading content. 

systemctl status pkg 
systemctl start pkg
systemctl stop pkg
systemctl restart pkg
systemctl enable pkg

        before            after
httpd   started  disbale  stopped
